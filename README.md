## Documentation

### Initial ideas:
#### Genre/Gameplay
- wave based (PvZ style)
- Different kinds of shapes and sizes of eggs, different stats similar to Bloons TD
- some kind of mix between fruit ninja (how to attack the eggs), PvZ (wave based combat), bloons tower defense (stronger and different variants of enemies), and vampire survivors (waves and variants)
---
#### Mechanics
- Physics based
- Something similar to fruit ninja, slicing eggs into pieces as they fly toward you instead of upwards
- Different tools for breaking different types of egg
- Eggs break apart into multiple pieces upon being hit
- "rotten" eggs could work as "bombs" and cause an instant loss. Missed eggs damage player, maybe difficulty scales quantity and damage of eggs
---
#### Story/world
- Player is defending their house from egg throwing robots? Or they are a baker of some kind
---
#### Items
- Kitchen knife (default)
- Baseball bat (Iron eggs)
- Gas Mask (gives one death shield to enemy "bomb")
- Harpoon (Tactical Eggs (eggs with military gear))
- Rolling pin (plastic eggs)
